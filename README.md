# üìÑ Web Document Scanner

Motivation: On Windows / macOS / Linux, you can easily share a printer for other computers in the same network to use (via CUPS for example). However, sharing a scanner is quite tricky. This web application is made to allow sharing scanner from one computer.

The application consists of 2 parts:
- Backend: To trigger scan function, manage files,...
- Frontend: To display the result, export to PDF,...
